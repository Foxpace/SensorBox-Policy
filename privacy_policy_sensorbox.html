    <strong>Location Data</strong><br>
    In order to save GPS coordinates on your phone/smartwatch in form of csv, location services have to be enabled in the background. <strong>Data are accessed only with permission and consciousness of the user.</strong><br><br>

    The data are accessed only during measurement. The measurement can be started only by the user by picking specific sensors to store in the device locally.
        The measurement is manifested by notification or by UI in the SensorBox, which is designed to show measurement. The SensorBox cannot start measurement on its own.
